    <h1>This second page details an average cafeteria meal</h1>

    <h2>It depicts a series of photos i've taken of meals I've purchased with my student card overlapped with each other:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>bagel, east asian special, mysterious schlop, etc</li>
        <li>demons and tortured spirits and the scream to represent the mysteriousness and slight evilness that eminates from mysterious cafeteria schlopp</li>
        <li>the food is pulsating constantly, like a living amalgamation of food</li>
        <li>food sounds, mushy wet, a little bit of screaming layered over</li>
    </ul>
